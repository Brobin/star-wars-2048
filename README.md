Star-Wars-2048
==============

Star Wars fork of 2048 by Gabrielle Cirulli

So yeah, 2048 is a really cool game and all, but I decided it would be cool to have a Star Wars version.

With a little tinkering with the css and whatnot, I got it!

You can play at http://tobinbrown.net/2048/starwars

Since its creation I have also added a high score board. See if you can get up there ;)
